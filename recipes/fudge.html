  <h3>A desert to go with every meal</h3>

  <p>I double the recipe and put in a glass baking dish (9x13 inches). Nice for holidays . . .</p>

  <h1>Ingredients</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>3 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
    <li>Â¼ cup butter</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped walnuts (Optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
