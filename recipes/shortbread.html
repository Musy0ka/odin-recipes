  <h3>These would really make your mornings</h3>

  <p>This is a compilation of several Shortbread recipes I have from British cookbooks.</p>
  <p>I have been to England three times and REAL shortbread is a favorite. It should use real butter and not be TOO sweet.</p>

  <h1>Ingredients</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/3 cup white rice flour</li>
  </ul>
